Listen Anonymously lets you listen to WhatsApp and Telegram voice messages without the sender ever knowing. No blue ticks. No read receipts. Complete privacy.

Have you ever received a voice message but weren't ready to respond? Maybe you're in a meeting, on public transport, or simply need time to think before replying. With Listen Anonymously, you can hear every voice message on your own terms — without triggering read receipts or blue ticks that tell the sender you've listened.

HOW IT WORKS

Using Listen Anonymously is incredibly simple. There's no complicated setup, no account creation, and no unnecessary permissions. Just follow these three easy steps:

1. Open WhatsApp or Telegram and find the voice message you want to listen to.
2. Tap and hold the voice message, then select "Share" or "Forward" from the menu.
3. Choose "Listen Anonymously" from the share sheet. The app opens and plays the voice message instantly.

That's it. The sender will never know you listened. No blue ticks will appear. No "seen" status will be triggered. Your privacy is fully protected.
